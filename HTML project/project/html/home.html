        <h2>Horses</h2>
        The horse (Equus ferus caballus) is one of two extant subspecies of Equus ferus. It is an odd-toed ungulate mammal belonging to the taxonomic family Equidae. The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature, Eohippus, into the large, single-toed animal of today. Humans began domesticating horses around 4000 BC, and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC. Horses in the subspecies caballus are domesticated, although some domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses. These feral populations are not true wild horses, as this term is used to describe horses that have never been domesticated, such as the endangered Przewalski's horse, a separate subspecies, and the only remaining true wild horse. There is an extensive, specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts, covering everything from anatomy to life stages, size, colors, markings, breeds, locomotion, and behavior. Horses' are built to run, allowing them to quickly escape predators, and they have both a well-developed sense of balance and a strong fight-or-flight response. Related to this need to flee from predators in the wild is an unusual trait: horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down, with younger horses tending to sleep significantly more than adults. Female horses, called mares, carry their young for approximately 11 months, and a young horse, called a foal, can stand and run shortly following birth. Most domesticated horses begin training under saddle or in harness between the ages of two and four. They reach full adult development by age five, and have an average lifespan of between 25 and 30 years. Horse breeds are loosely divided into three categories based on general temperament: spirited "hot bloods" with speed and endurance; "cold bloods", such as draft horses and some ponies, suitable for slow, heavy work; and "warmbloods", developed from crosses between hot bloods and cold bloods, often focusing on creating breeds for specific riding purposes, particularly in Europe. There are more than 300 breeds of horse in the world today, developed for many different uses. Horses and humans interact in a wide variety of sport competitions and non-competitive recreational pursuits, as well as in working activities such as police work, agriculture, entertainment, and therapy. Horses were historically used in warfare, from which a wide variety of riding and driving techniques developed, using many different styles of equipment and methods of control. Many products are derived from horses, including meat, milk, hide, hair, bone, and pharmaceuticals extracted from the urine of pregnant mares. Humans provide domesticated horses with food, water, and shelter, as well as attention from specialists such as veterinarians and farriers.

        <h2>Dogs</h2>
        The domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris when considered a subspecies of the wolf or Canis familiaris when considered a distinct species) is a member of the genus Canis (canines), which forms part of the wolf-like canids, and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore. The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa as modern wolves are not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated, which implies that the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct. The dog was the first species to be domesticated and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. Their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely attuned to human behavior and they are able to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canid species. Dogs vary widely in shape, size and colors. They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and military, companionship and, more recently, aiding disabled people and therapeutic roles. This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of "man's best friend".

        <h2>Tigers</h2>
        Tiger (Panthera tigris) är ett kattdjur som endast lever i Asien. Tigern är det största nu levande kattdjuret. Man delar upp de idag förekommande bestånden i sex underarter. Utöver detta känner man till tre utdöda underarter. De flesta tigrar lever i fuktig tropisk och subtropisk lövskog, men finns även i tempererade löv- och barrskogar. I denna miljö utgör pälsens mönster bra kamouflage. Tigern är en god simmare och badar ofta. Den jagar ensam och äter främst medelstora djur ur familjerna svindjur och hjortdjur, men tigern är opportunistisk och äter det den kommer över, så dieten inkluderar även fisk, fåglar, insekter, amfibier, reptiler, gnagare, piggsvin och primater. Människan är den enda art som utgör något allvarligt hot mot tigern. Tjuvjakt och människans omvandling av miljön i de områden där den lever har tillsammans reducerat tigerpopulationerna kraftigt, så att den nu räknas som starkt hotad. Trivialnamnet tiger härstammar från det grekiska ordet tigris som troligtvis är besläktat med det avestiska ordet för pil, tigri. Det skulle därmed syfta på djurets potential till höga hastigheter.
